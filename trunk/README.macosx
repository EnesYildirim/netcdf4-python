Although netcdf4-python is not yet part of MacPorts (http://www.macports.org), you can use the 
include Portfile to install it using a local Portfile repository.  See ports/README
for more details.  Once macports is installed, and your local Portfile repo is set up,
all you have to do to install netcdf4-python and it's dependencies is run "sudo port install py27-netcdf4".

google "macports local portfile" for more information on creating a local Portfile repository.
