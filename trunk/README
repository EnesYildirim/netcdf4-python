Python/numpy interface to the netCDF version 4 library.

Quick Start
-----------

make sure numpy is installed.
'python setup.py install' installs the netCDF4 and netcdftime modules.
The environment variables HDF5_DIR and NETCDF4_DIR must be 
set to point to the locations of the HDF5 and netCDF4 libraries and
headers before setup.py is run.

To install just the pure-python netcdftime module, 
run 'python setup-netcdftime.py install'

Unit tests are in the 'test' directory.
To run all the tests, executre 'cd test; python run_all.py'.
