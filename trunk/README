Python/numpy interface to the netCDF version 4 library.

Quick Start
-----------

'python setup.py install' installs the netCDF4, netCDF4_classic
MFnetCDF4_classic and netcdftime modules. To install just the
pure-python netcdftime module, just run 'python setup-netcdftime.py install'
The environment variables HDF5_DIR and NETCDF4_DIR must be 
set to point to the locations of the HDF5 and netCDF4 libraries and
headers before setup.py is run. The prerequiste libraries (numpy and pyrex)
must be installed first.

Unit tests for netCDF4 and netCDF4_classic are in the test and test_classic
directories.  To run, execute the 'run_all.py' scripts in each of those
directories.
