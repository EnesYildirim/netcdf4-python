Python/numpy interface to the netCDF version 4 library.

Quick Start
-----------

make sure numpy is installed.
'python setup.py install' installs the netCDF4 and netcdftime modules.
The environment variables HDF5_DIR and NETCDF4_DIR must be 
set to point to the locations of the HDF5 and netcdf-4 libraries and
headers before setup.py is run.

If you can't install the HDF5 and netcdf-4 libs on your system,
but have netcdf-3 installed, set NETCDF3_DIR to point to the
location of the netcdf-3 library and headers, and then run
'python setup-nc3.py install'. This will install the netCDF3 module.

To install just the pure-python netcdftime module, 
run 'python setup-netcdftime.py install'

Unit tests are in the 'test' directory.
To run all the tests, execute 'cd test; python run_all.py'.
Tests for the netCDF3 module are in the 'test3' directory.
Additional examples are in the 'examples' directory.
