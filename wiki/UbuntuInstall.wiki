#summary How to install on Ubuntu

Read on for instructions on how to install netcdf4-python on an Ubuntu Jaunty machine. The same instructions should work as well on previous versions. 

= Installing the required dependencies =

There are only two dependencies to install, HDF5 and netCDF4.

== HDF5 ==

# Download the current [http://www.hdfgroup.org/ftp/HDF5/current/src/ HDF5 source release].
# Unpack, go into the directory and execute:
{{{
./configure --prefix=/usr/local --enable-shared --enable-hl
make 
make install
}}}

You might need to do {{{sudo make install}}}. I set up permissions on my machine so that I can write freely on /usr/local, which is where I put the stuff I install myself, but this might not be a good idea if other persons use the same machine. 

== netCDF4 ==

# Download the current [http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/downloads/netcdf/ftp/netcdf-4.0.1.tar.gz netCDF4 source release]. The link might not work when the version number will change, please update the page when this happens. 
# Unpack, go into the directory and execute:
{{{
./configure --enable-netcdf-4 --with-hdf5=/usr/local --enable-shared --prefix=/usr/local
make 
make install
}}}


= Installing netcdf4-python = 
When both HDF5 and netCDF4 are in /usr/local, make sure the linker will be able to find those libraries by executing
{{{
sudo ldconfig
}}}
then installing netcdf4-python is just a matter of doing
{{{
python setup.py install
}}}
